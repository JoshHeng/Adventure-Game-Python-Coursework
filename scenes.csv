Nevertheless, they check the CCTV footage and to their amazement find that they did see you being attacked by something not human.

S3,decision,You are dragged by the alien through lots of corridors into a secret room| where many other aliens are congregating. You are tied to a chair.  They stare at you for a while and then babble excitedly| prodding you. %newline%Suddenly| you see one of your colleagues amongst the rabble. He walks up to you and says ‘%playername%| how nice to see you. It seems you picked a fight with the wrong species.

S3BC,normal,,S3A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S4,decision,You decide to put out notices across the space station inviting all peaceful species which aren’t human to come and see the manager in his office. The word spreads quickly and soon everyone is talking about aliens| but nothing turns up. After a week| another meeting is called amongst you and the senior management.

S4BB,normal,You try to spin around but you are too slow. The alien knocks you to the ground.,S3,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S5,question,You quickly put the whole station on lockdown – no one is now able to get in or out between sectors without the security team opening the door remotely in their secure base. Then| you get armed up with body armour and a tazer| and along with 5 of the security guards| you systematically search each room.%newline%When you reach the catering sector| you discover that one of the cleaning warehouses have been taken over by the aliens. You find hundreds of aliens roaming around the huge area| some even on arrays of computers. On hearing the door open| they all look and stare at you. A deathly silence transpires. %newline%Suddenly| they all rush towards you| raising weapons. Your team desperately contact control on the radio| but they know it’s too late.

S5B,decision,You are too slow. As you look back| terrified| you and your team are mobbed by the aliens. Within the next minute| you are all tied up| sitting in a row on the ground. %newline%All the aliens stare at you viciously| drooling. Amongst the thong of extraterrestrial creatures| one of your colleagues steps out.%newline%“Welcome| %playername%| to our base|” he smiles wickedly. You have finally found the place which you have been looking for – the only problem is it seems like we are the ones in control. In fact| we have no use for your security team as they would never be beneficial to us| so we might as well show you how serious we are when we threaten to kill you.” He nods to the alien next to him| who efficiently raises his rifle and shoots all 5 of your team in the head. They slump to the ground| limp| with shocked faces. “Our master species are going to take over this space station| and we are asking for your help to do this|” he says. “If you help us| you will be treated equally once we have taken over the rest of your species. If not| we will just tie you up now and let you watch us overruling you friends| then kill you once we have been successful. What do you want to do? We don’t mind either way…”%newline%Type ‘J’ to join or ‘R’ to refuse.,,,,,,,j,,S5BA,r,,S5BB,,,

S5AB,normal,The aliens start shooting through the door and one of the bullets hits you| sliding cleanly through your chest.

What do you say?%newline%Type ‘T’ to tell them the truth or type ‘L’ to lie and pretend everything is fine.,,,,,,,t,,S6AA,l,,S6AB,,,
S6B,decision,You quickly change your mind| determined not to help them. It is probably too late – the suicide device is already in your bloodstream – but you might as well give it a try| you’ll probably end up dead anyway. %newline%How are you going to fight back?%newline%Type ‘R’ to report it to security or ‘F’ to physically go back and fight the aliens.,,,,,,,r,,S6BA,f,,S6BB,,,

There is no one else in sight but you can see that he has a remote with a big red button on his desk – probably the activation system for the suicide device you have in your bloodstream.%newline%As you approach him| he sees you and picks up the remote.,,,,S6BBA,,S6BBB,,,,,,,,,
S6ABA,normal,You quickly dive on him and wrench the remote from his hand successfully. As he recovers from the ground| you run as fast as you can to the security department| knowing that there is a high chance that there is a backup remote.,S9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S6ABB,normal,You step forward to try to stop your inevitable fate but it is too late – he presses a button in a remote on his hand and you suddenly feel very drowsy. You sway side to side and then fall and lose consciousness.%newline%%newline%You lose – the aliens have killed you.,end,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You have two choices – you can join us| or we will now have to kill you|” he says.%newline%Type ‘J’ to join the aliens or ‘R’ to refuse and be killed.,,,,,,,j,,S7AA,r,,S7AB,,,
S7AA,normal,,S3A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S7AB,normal,Your colleague looks sadly at you. “It’s your choice|” he says.%newline%Then he picks up a gun from inside his coat| aims and fires.%newline%%newline%You lose – the aliens have killed you.,end,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S8,question,From the distance| you can hear running feet| and it quickly gets louder. Hopeful| you and the others in your team start shouting for help. %newline%The reinforcements find you| and there are more people than you expected. It turns out that once people knew what was going on| everyone came to help. Most humans on the space station are all armoured up| ready for battle.%newline%You make eye contact and mouth a silent countdown. “3| 2| 1|” you suddenly open the door and everyone rushes in| shooting at any alien in their sight.

S9A,question,You manage to make it to the security centre and they let you in. You explain everything you know and tell them where their hideout is located. You also explain about the suicide and monitoring devices and they look at you sadly. They explain that they think you should go to the medical bay to try and get it taken out| but until then you can’t stay any longer – if the aliens are monitoring you| they could hear their plans.
